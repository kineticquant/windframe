## About
Drag and drop Tailwind components from the left-hand side of this application into the canvas easily! Place them exactly where you want for formatting, then subsequently generate an HTML export of your canvas which is available for download instantly. This file will download as "windframe.html" and include the CDN for Tailwind CSS inside of it automatically.

## Key Benefits
- Simple UI available to be launched locally
- Serverless setup and has absolutely no back-end
- Contains a components.json which can be modified to add whatever component designs are desired, or new components as-desired
- No limitations on where you add elements on the canvas
